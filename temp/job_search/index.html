<h3 id="section-2-resumes-in-a-world-of-ai-and-applicant-tracking-systems-atss">Section 2: Resumes in a World of AI and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applicant Tracking System (ATS): Software package used by companies to recieve, analyze, and tracking incoming candidates.</li>
<li>Resume needs to be both powerful for people who are actually reading it and also to have key words in there so that when our resume goes into a software package which is then analyzes the data as part of assessing your candidate</li>
<li>Labor market experts know that most people are looking at resumes for about 6 seconds before they put that resume in the interesting pile or in the garbage bin</li>
<li>eye scanning technique: eyes tend to gravitate these areas of the space. these are the spaces on the page where your resume needs to shout that I have the skills that your organization needs to thrive</li>
<li>go to job descriptions of your desired job , the skills that are higher on those job descriptions are higher priority skills for those organizations. the best mix is to mix the skills posted on job descriptions with your natural talents.</li>
<li>Candidates often have hard explaining their transferrable skills, finding evidence to have the skills required for the job. this is easy actually. most candiates are like icebergs they only show or think that they have only very  small percentage of skills, in reality they have so many more skills than even they know. The way you do this is through the concept of framing. It is thinking about professional and academic voluntary history and learning how to select the right experience that you can then extract and surround with the right languages that recruiters and hr managers understand</li>
<li>The thing is HR manages are not going to be looking at your resume as like an investigating journalist would looking into your past. what they are looking for is the evidence that you have the skills their organization needs to get going. It is known in the bussiness comminity the best way to get an organization from point A to point B is by putting the right people in the bus.</li>
<li>Keyword optimization; ATS: they basically take your resume and they split them up and parse them. then they search them for key words and then they rank applicants on the presence of key words. THis is particularly very important for large organizations. The way to fight this is through anti robot protocol.</li>
<li>Anti Robot Protocol:
<ol>
<li>Matching language: open up a job description and look at the language they use and look for some key words and make sure those keywords appear in your resume</li>
<li>Buzzwords: go to target organizations website and look for buzzwords they use on their website and make sure you include them in your resume</li>
<li>Right Titles: change internship to Analyst (internship)</li>
<li>Relevant software: list some software applicable to target companies use; make sure the names of the software are included in the tech section of the resume; One of the hacks you can use it here is to take some tutorials on software for some particular position and include it in your technical section of your resume and besides that software program put basic. you can defend that in interview that you have taken tutorials on this and yes I know this is important for this particular role</li>
<li>Keyword audit: copy your resume and go to eazels legendary website and use the cloudify tool and see world cloud. the words that are bigger appear more frequently. this is kind of what robots likely to see.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Word choice, tone, personal branding: people just don&rsquo;t function from words, they also get ideas and emotions; eg. sustainability-wind turbine, urban- fast paced life. Same way that happens on your resume, on your linkedin profile and cover letter. So you want to be associated with success and trust and action. use Eazl&rsquo;s Power Language Tool (or find something else similar) that has action words by category. samples of success language and also examples of good phrasing.</li>
<li>supercharge the body content of your resume: means organizational description, position description, bullet points and project section. The strategy here is  weaving a brands into your resume that people know, quantifying whenever you can (people trust numbers) and working details (details help invisible to become visible which helps you build trust). Details are about journalistic questions (who, what, where, why, when, how)</li>
<li>Include my knowdelge on generating 3d pdfs and how well i did it in my resume.</li>
<li>A powerful executive summary: It is kind of like your albums cover. this is the first impression that your are goint to send to the audience and what you want these words to do is a line with big six skills in the kind of role that you are targeting. Also try leveraging the matching language and buzzwords techniques</li>
<li>Resume myths:
<ol>
<li>Myth: It is a place to tell your life story. True: It is like a key to open doors for you.</li>
<li>Myth: Resume has to be one page long (this is pretty ridiculous) True: If you have lot of work experience or voluntary experience then your resume will go over one page, most people are reading your resume on a computer so page length has no limit.</li>
<li>Myth: You have to show constant employment, True: Anybody who is hiring for a position going to know that job search can take a time. the average job search can take about 9 months. This is fine. But what is most important is that you need to be able to speak about these gaps and employment when you go into these interviews</li>
<li>Myth: Non-paid work experience does not count. True: Voluntarism, any kind of civil service, internships; all contribute valuable experiences.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fix these: lack of a professional email address, bad grammar, lack of a voice mail message that sounds legitimate</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-write-your-winning-resume-together">Let’s Write Your Winning Resume Together</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reverse engineering and building the big six skills
<ul>
<li>You want to reverse engineer the skills and mix the little bit of your unique differentiators together</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="job-search-20-integrating-technology-and-networking-into-your-job-search">Job Search 2.0 Integrating Technology and Networking into Your Job Search</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is about networking and network management</li>
<li>Companies are people and when you have connections with people in companies, that is a very good way to get into the door</li>
<li>Spend at least 50 % of your job searching time on networking and do genuine networking = network with people that you find genuinely interesting, have little informal conversations</li>
<li>Why organizations hire and how it impacts your job search ? Answers could be:
<ol>
<li>The organization is growing: know why they are growing, generally take that as a good sign and you want to be onboard with their strategy</li>
<li>The person who works there got terminated (or fired): if that is the case, you figure out as much as you can about the terms of their departure (was it performance issue or cultural match) anyway you can softly ask question about that will craft your message in an intelligent way</li>
<li>The organization is reorganizing: means they are shrinking certain teams and growing other ones; you want to know the strategy behind that because you can align with that strategy and appear as a more appealing candidate.</li>
<li>Somebody is retiring: usually they promote some people and have opportunities available on the junior size</li>
<li>The key take away is that you want to get that strategic information and use it in places like cover letter and informal interviews and just in informal networking</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>your secret weapon - job search CRM (Customer relationship management)</li>
<li>Hidden job Market (Informal job market): Companies hire through personal referrals and networking rather than putting adds on places like linkedin, glassdoor, etc. The labor market says that 70-80 % jobs are neve publicly advertised, they are hidden. Network to get the information about these jobs</li>
<li>Informal Chats: When you actually reach out to create informal chats with people you haven&rsquo;t met before
<ul>
<li>Jr level people will respond and accept chat roughly 56% of the time</li>
<li>Mid level people will respond and accept chats roughly 22 % of the time</li>
<li>Sr level  people - roughly 9% of the time.</li>
<li>The above percentages are different for different industries also different for different counties</li>
<li>For this you should have an excellent LinkedIn profile and resume</li>
</ul>
</li>
